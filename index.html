      <h1> Climate Change </h1>
        <h2 class="title"> How is it affecting us?</h2>
          <p>Climate Change refers to the broad range of global phenomena
            created predominantly by fossil fuels that add excess heat into the
            atmosphere. This excess heat causes temperature rising and higher
            sea levels, both life-threatening weather events according to NASA.
            This increase in temperatures in the last mid-20th century is 95%
            attributed to human action. Since the late 19th century the Earth's
            average surface temperature has risen by 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit.
            In fact, the year 2016 is the warmest year on record. These rises in temperature
            have led to decreasing ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. On average,
            Antarctica and Greenland 286 billion tons of ice per year from 1993-2016. Gobal sea levels
            have risen 8 inches in the last century. These changes in cliamte will
            in the near future shorten growing seasons, lead to stronger hurricanes or other
            extreme weather events, increase heat waves, and it is projected to lead to an "Ice-Free Arctic".
            It is predicted by Climate Scientists that by 2040 if no real, drastic change is put in place then
            then the effects will be "baked" into the natural systems of the planet. </p>

                <h3 class="title">What can we do?</h3>
                  <p> So you may be wondering what we can do as teenagers to combat this global issue?
                  Well, there are tons of minute changes that anyone can make to reduce their carbon footprint. As an avid shopper, I have
                  made it a priority to buy from sustainable brands. Reformation, for example, is a brand that creates 100% sustainable fashion from
                  recycled fabrics. Additionally, I enjoy thrift shopping and reusing old clothes to reduce
                  the amount of clothing waste I have. The old saying "reduce, reuse, recycle" is also crucial in reducing your carbon footprints.
                  Using smaller amouts of plastic is also small ways to help out. Volunteering to clean the oceans or communities in your town also
                  help. Organizations like 4Ocean sell bracelets that clean the ocean. For every bracelet purchased from 4Ocean 1 pound of
                  trash is removed from the ocean. In less than 2 years 4Ocean has removed 6,078,453 pounds of trash from the ocean. Lastly, reducing your meat
                  and dairy intake will further lessen your carbon footprint. The meat industry is responsible for massive amounts of carbon emmissions, so reducing
                  your meat intake will lessen the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere.</p>

         should take some time to learn about even if you can’t vote because it is our future. Most of us don’t know who is running and what
         their views are but we should. These people will be running our country! The country with countless of problems that need to be fixed.

             <h1> Gun Control </h1>
               <h2 class="title"><center> How is it affecting us?</center></h2>
                 <p> Gun control is defined as the regulation of the sale and use of firearms by civilians. Many
                  countries have strict regulations to prevent incidents which can result in multiple lives lost. Gun
                  control however is a very controversial topic, especially in America. Students and parents
                  demand for action. Then, people forget about the occurrence and unfortunately, a new shooting
                  takes place and the debate occurs. However, after Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, commonly
                  known as the Parkland Shooting, more demand for change happened. Protests erupted and students
                  all over the country, walked out to protest. A country wide movement, known as
                  the March Of Our Lives.
                  The March of Our Lives was a student-led protest in order to prevent gun violence in the United States.
                  It was planned not a while after the Parkland shooting left seventeen students and teachers dead in total.
                  The protest was “the largest single-day protest in the history of the nation’s capital,” according to USA
                  Today. The shooting inspired not only student survivors, but moved parents, and students from all over the
                  country, to form a movement in hopes of persuading lawmakers to address the issue of gun violence in and
                  outside of schools. Due to this movement, The US Department of Justice progressed to ban bump stocks, an
                  attachment that makes a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster, in March of 2018. Bump stocks were not used in
                  the Parkland shooting, but it was used in the fatal 2017 shooting in Las Vegas, the deadliest one in modern
                  US history. This was a big step, but more can be done.</p>

                  <h3 class="title"> What can we do?</h3>
                  <p>To help prevent future shootings, donating to gun control groups can be a huge help. Everytown for Gun Safety
                     works to prevent gun violence through raising awareness and promoting gun-control codification. Another campaign
                     is the Brady Campaign, which aims to cut gun deaths in half by 2025; the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, which
                     use policy development and advocacy to prevent shooting violence; and the Giffords Law Center, which was
                     founded by former congresswoman Gabby Giffords — who was shot in 2011 — and her husband Mark Kelly. Additionally,
                     calling out politicians for taking money from the gun lobby, you can also reach out to your elected officials to let
                     them know how important gun-control is to you and other people.

            <p> Gun control is a topic I chose because as a student, it is something we think about a lot.
              As students in America, we are always wondering, 'am I next'? Raising awareness about this
              deathly issue is very essential. After the Gilroy Festival shooting in California and
              the Walmart shooting in Mississippi, it seemed appropriate and needed.
              I am into coding because last year I did Kode With Klossy and it was fun and
              I wanted to learn more.
              A fun fact about me is that I run track. </p>
              <h2 class="title"> Ally</h2>
                <p> I chose to write about Climate Change because I think it's one of the most
                  important issues my generation has to fix. It's crucial that the world stays together so we can advance
                  as humans in a clean, environmentally-freindly society. Additionally, I am a vegan
                  because I believe in the perseverance of animal habitats which is extremely endangered by Climate
                  Change. I started coding in 8th grade using simple languages like Scratch because my friend
                  convinced me to go to computer coding club with her. This past year I started a Girls Who Code club
                  at my school. Technology is the future, so why not take it and use it for all it has to offer. I became
                  interested in KWK from a friend who went a few years ago and now I'm here. I hope to apply next year or
                  in years to come. A fun fact about me is I love the show The Office and have watched all 9 seasons 3 times!

                <p> My name is Amina Rhamatzada. I’m 15 years old going into sophomore year of high school at Half Hallow Hills High School East.
                  I joined Kode With Klossy to learn something out of my comfort zone and meet new people. Kode with Klossy really has opened my
                  eyes up to a new language that I can continue to learn and use throughout my life. I chose to write about the 2020 election because
                   although I cannot vote, I am really interested in learning about all the candidates because this is my country and I believe that even
                   if you can vote or not, we all should be aware of who will be running our counrty. </p>

            <h2> Feminism </h2>
              <p>Feminism is a movement that was born of women being fed up of the repeatedly unequal
                treatment they received in every aspect of life. Feminism was born out of a need for
                equality, and a need to be treated as a human being. Feminist issues have evolved
                since the birth of the movement, but feminism itself has not. Women and men
                around the world are fighting to be treated equally.
